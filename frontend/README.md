== TODO ==

* Call ImageMagick convert in a cleaner way for conversion of CR2 files.
  Currently there are hard-coded paths in there and forking of external
  processes.
* Display images in correct orientation and proportions, but restrict within
  the dimensions of the labels.
* Pre-load a few images in advance so that moving to the next image in the
  "queue" is faster.
